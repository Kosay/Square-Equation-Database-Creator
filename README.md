# Square-Equation-Database-Creator

This tool creates a database for square equations. $$aX^2 + b X + c = 0,$$
Where $a \neq 0$. If there is a real solution, the values $f$ will be 1, otherwise $f=0$. It saves $a$, $b$, and $c$ values. It has a choice to generate factors ($a$, $b, and $c$) as integers.
